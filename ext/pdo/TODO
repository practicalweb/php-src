In no particular order:

Low-level:

- $dbh->quote()
- Scrollable cursors
- meta data from driver, such as server version and supported features
- field meta data from statement handles
- LOB support via Streams API
- iterator support
- make errors generated at the pdo level (as opposed to driver level) use the
  selected error mode.

Not-so-low-level:
- fetchAll(), single row, single column fetches etc.

Could be more...
